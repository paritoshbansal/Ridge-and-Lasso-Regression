# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
# why we use Lasso and Ridge Regression
1. when our model is over fitted that means when ourr training data fittes very accurately to slope and testind data is not fitted very well then we use use penality factor or reputation which is basically called as Lasso(L1) and Ridge(L2) to make our model generalised.
2. Lasso and Ridge both are penality factor which is used to make our model optimised.

# Object:-
To check whether the model is overfitted model or not.

# Conclusion:-
we are having good accuracy score in both lasso and ridge regression that means our model is not overfitted.
