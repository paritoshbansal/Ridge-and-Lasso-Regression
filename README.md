# Ridge-and-Lasso-Regression
when our model is over fitted that means when ourr training data fittes very accurately to slope and testind data is not fitted very well then we use use penality factor or reputation which is basically called as Lasso(L1) and Ridge(L2) to make our model generalised.
Lasso and Ridge both are penality factor which is used to make our model optimised.
